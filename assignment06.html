			<p class="meta">Points: 100</p>
			<p class="meta">Critique: 2 Groups</p>

      <p>You will continue exploring web design by creating a series of designs for a common view in contemporary sites: The user profile page. Any website that has a social component (users can share content, view the content shared by others, network, send messages, etc.) often has a profile page for each user.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>...there are five important things you can do to make sure they see&mdash;and understand&mdash;as much of your site as possible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page</li>
          <li>Take advantage of conventions</li>
          <li>Break pages up into clearly defined areas</li>
          <li>Make it obvious what's clickable</li>
          <li>Minimize noise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&mdash;Steve Krug, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/137231/article.html">Billboard Design 101</a></p>
      </blockquote>

			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Practice designing full page web layouts in Photoshop/Illustrator.</li>
				<li>Application of the skills you’ve previously practiced regarding designing web components and content hierarchy.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>Design a social profile page for mobile and desktop views. These will be for imaginary sites, so don't get caught up trying to figure out exactly what the parent site does and don't waste time making a logo for the parent site. Think in more specific terms, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;This is the user profile screen for a dating website&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;This is the user profile screen for a retro-looking photo sharing website&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;...for a general social media website&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;...for a wine tasting website&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;...for a bright, colorful, teen focused website&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;...for a serious gamer website&rdquo;</li>
        <li>...etc. Be creative and have fun with it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Yours or Mine?</h2>
			<p>There are 2 types of user profile screen: Yours, and mine. When I look at yours, I see something different than when I look at my own. Usually, when I look at my own I see options to edit or update my profile, along with a variety of other things that aren't public. Take a moment to look at your own profile and then someone else&rsquo;s on Facebook, Instagram, etc.</p>
      <p>In this project, we will be designing <strong>someone else&rsquo;s</strong> profile screen.</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Find at least 4 examples of user profile pages (websites only) for research. </li>
        <li>Design a user profile screen in a desktop and mobile view.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Profile picture</li>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>An option to connect (friending/following/etc.)</li>
        <li>An option to message</li>
        <li>Also consider:
          <ul>
            <li>A feed of content</li>
            <li>Intro description,</li>
            <li>Follower or friend count</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other content that you think is appropriate to your sites&rsquo; theme.</p>

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      <p>Exact file dimensions and any grids or guides you use are up to you. But take some time to research common desktop and mobile “breakpoints” and carefully consider how your designs might be used under different user circumstances.</p>
      <p>Your desktop view should show what happens beyond your maximum breakpoint. Both views can be as tall as they need to be.</p>
      <p>But, here are some ranges of widths as a guideline:<br>
        Mobile: 320px&ndash;480px<br>
        Desktop: 768px&ndash;1280px
      </p>

			<h2>Presentation</h2>
			<p>Make a section on your Invision board called <strong>Assignment 6: Research</strong><br>Post the research examples in this section. Arrange them neatly.</p>
      <p>Make a section on your Invision board called <strong>Assignment 6: Designs</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
          <li>Place your designs with a realistic browser height for their view. You could mock-up these designs in a desktop and mobile browser if you wish. Arrange them side by side.</li>
          <li>Additionally, place your full designs at their full height.</li>
          <li>If you have additional designs, or want to show state changes, you can put as many designs as you want here.</li>
			</ul>
