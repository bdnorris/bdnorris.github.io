			<p class="meta">Points: 50</p>
		  <p class="meta">Critique: 4 Groups</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Step 2 of assignment seven will consist of two parts. Planning the architecture of all the pages of your site, and creating a “low-fi” digital sketch of your site called a “wireframe”. The purpose of these exercises is to plan as much as possible and work out any potential issues before jumping into the design and development phase of the project.</p>

			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<ul>
        <li>Introduction to modern web design workflow.</li>
        <li>Design and analysis of websites and user interfaces.</li>
        <li>Exploration of information architecture concepts.</li>
        <li>Introduction to “wireframing”/low-fidelity sketching.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Information Architecture and “Site Mapping”</h2>
      <p>In Part 1, you were directed to have a certain number of pages in your site. Now it’s time to document those, categorize them into sections, and map out their relationships.</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://alistapart.com/article/flexiblefueleducatingtheclientonia">
        <p>“I often tell clients that Information Architecture (IA) establishes the baseline, or foundation, for a solid site structure. It helps create the traffic patterns and navigational routes that get the customer from A to B in language that is helpful and easy to understand. In fact, IA is the first step in meeting customer goals and can therefore increase brand awareness and product or service sales.”</p>
        <p>&mdash;Keith LaFerriere</p>
        <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/flexiblefueleducatingtheclientonia" target="_blank">https://alistapart.com/article/flexiblefueleducatingtheclientonia</a>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Tasks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Define your main content</li>
        <li>Decide on which pages those content items will live</li>
        <li>Create a tree-style map of those pages</li>
        <li>Define your navigation areas and what they contain</li>
      </ul>

      <p>They’re typically shown from the top down; where Home and any other common landing pages would be at the top, main section pages underneath (often corresponding to the main navigation), sub-sections underneath that, and so on.</p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>
        The most common would be a tree view:<br>
        <a href="http://spot.pcc.edu/~gkerr/general/assets/sitemap-example.jpg" target="_blank">http://spot.pcc.edu/~gkerr/general/assets/sitemap-example.jpg</a><br>
        <a href="https://www.gliffy.com/examples/site-map" target="_blank">https://www.gliffy.com/examples/site-map</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, a more complex isometric view is useful:<br>
        <a href="http://baynesmedia.com/category/user-experience/information-architecture/" target="_blank">http://baynesmedia.com/category/user-experience/information-architecture/</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        ...whatever is most appropriate for your site.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sitemaps may also share a lot in common with a map of the user flow, corresponding to the user stories you’ve previously written.<br>
        <a href="https://speckyboy.com/collection-inspiring-sitemaps-user-flow-maps/" target="_blank">https://speckyboy.com/collection-inspiring-sitemaps-user-flow-maps/</a>
      </p>

      <p>We’re aiming for a <strong>traditional sitemap</strong> on this project, that <strong>must account for all pages on our site</strong> (large amounts of repetitive pages would be abstracted into a “stack” or some other visual metaphor). Additionally, incorporating some “flow” concepts might be useful, especially if the user flow is particularly complex.</p>

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <p>You can develop your “sitemap” in the style and program of your choosing. I'm providing an Illustrator file to assist you with the “thumbnail” style.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://briannorris.io/msuweb/Thumb_Wireframing_03.ai">Thumb_Wireframing_03.ai</a> (right-click, save download as)<br>
        <a href="http://briannorris.io/msuweb/Thumb_Wireframing_03_leg.ai">Thumb_Wireframing_03_leg.ai</a> (if you have trouble opening the above)
      </p>

      <p><strong>Minimum Requirement</strong> would be a simple document with pages represented by rectangles with a clear hierarchy (levels of content). Dimensions of this document are up to you.</p>

      <h2>“Wireframing:” Planning your most important pages</h2>

      <h3>Examples and Resources</h3>
      <p>Huge list of tips for wireframing, we will only have time to touch on the basics, but this article is a good summary of how far you can take wireframing, especially on a large project that might involve many team members and a large budget.<br>
      <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/wireframe-perfectionist-guide/" target="_blank">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/wireframe-perfectionist-guide/</a></p>

      <h3>And also...“Prototyping:” Planning your interactions</h3>
      <p>The methods described here won’t apply, but the “why’s” regarding prototyping do:<br>
      <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/the-skeptics-guide-to-low-fidelity-prototyping/" target="_blank">The Skeptics Guide to Low Fidelity Prototyping</a> <span class="important">&laquo; Please Read!</span></p>

      <p>Essentially, prototyping might include simply adding clickable links to your wireframes, but often includes interactive items programmed in javascript and animation.</p>
      <p>There are will be <strong>no requirements</strong> for prototyping on this project. I simply want you to explore and have awareness of the possibilities.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>Choosing a tool for wireframing and prototyping is difficult. It depends a lot on the level of detail you want to establish. Simple thumbnail wireframes can be used to plan the IA and content areas as I’ve mentioned above, and further detail can be achieved with static wireframes consisting of gray boxes and text in Illustrator, Photoshop or Sketch.</p>
      <p>You can also go further with wireframes and create semi-functional mock-ups. We’re going to combine wireframing and some basic prototyping in this project using a tool called <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> is a full site builder. It can produce production ready pages, and the company has services for hosting and a content management system. Webflow has a few drag and drop <strong>responsive</strong> layout items that can speed up the wireframing process. We’re going to use Webflow to produce our wireframes.</p>
      <p>The free version of Webflow will only allow 2 pages. So we’re going to start there. With my assistance and approval, pick your two most important pages for your site. You’ll develop wireframes in Webflow of these two pages.</p>
      <p>Your wireframe should be visually simple, as in the linked examples. No graphics, photos, etc. Just text and shapes to represent images/buttons/etc.</p>
      <p>Feel free to use Webflow’s built in form fields, linking capabilities, etc. to enhance your wireframes with some basic interactions.</p>

      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>The main reason I’m choosing Webflow as the tool for this exercise is it’s great responsive support. You will be able to layout a page, and in real-time, slide the viewport to different widths and see the adjustments happening live.</p>
      <p><strong>You must consider the view, all the way from mobile to desktop for this assignment.</strong></p>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>Instead of the typical critique, you will be grouped up with other students to analyze each other wireframes. I will post groups here when ready.</p>
      <p><strong>Your role when looking at another’s wireframes:</strong> Okay, these aren’t real sites, they may or may not clickable, but you should still be able to look at the wireframes, and imagine yourself clicking through. Are there areas that you don’t understand? What happens if you click that button? What does this box represent? Ask lots of questions.</p>
      <p><strong>Your role when you’re showing your wireframe:</strong> Walk your group through your wireframes and sitemap quickly, then let them ask questions. Answer, but pay attention when your answer seems to be need a lot of explanation. It should be obvious what the items on your page are for. If you don’t have an answer, or it takes an inordinate amount of explaining...congrats, you’ve just found an improvement you can make through our facsimile of user testing. </p>
      <p>Collect information from your user testing session, make any necessary adjustments, and make sure you have included the necessary items on your InVision board as noted below.</p>

      <h2>Presentation</h2>
      <p>Please place in your InVision account, under the heading “Assignment 7: Information Architecture and Wireframes”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Sitemap, as text or image, whatever’s most appropriate.</li>
        <li>A text note of your published Webflow project wireframing URL.</li>
