      <h4>HTML/CSS Path</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Front-end Foundations <em>(10 points)</em></h3>
          <p>This course introduces you to you the basics of HTML and CSS. (10 points)</p>

          <h3>The Elements of Web Design <em>(10 points)</em></h3>
          <p>This course digs into the user-centered planning and workflow of building a site or app. A lot of the content here is based on the idea of user testing. (User testing is hard, and expensive, but if you can begin to better put yourself in the user’s place, you can user test yourself. You can also use colleagues and friends as cheap user testing.)</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Fundamentals of Design <em>(5 points)</em></h3>
          <p>This course talks about type, color, and layout in reference to web design. It’s geared towards non-designers, so much of this is things you already know, and probably have a better handle on than this course. However, there is a handful of useful content here that should be new to you, so I think it’s worth tackling. You will be annoyed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>CSS Cross-Country <em>15 points)</em></h3>
          <p>This course throws you into the deep-end of CSS. Remember to check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> or <a href="http://cssreference.io/">cssreference.io</a> for help!</p>

        <li>
          <h3>Front-end Formations <em>(10 points)</em></h3>
          <p>This course talks about some newer items in HTML/CSS. Of course, everything is new to you anyway, but the items this course talks about are important. Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> or the <a href="http://msuweb.design">msuweb.design</a> source code for help.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>Discovering Dev Tools [in the electives path] <em>(5 points)</em></h3>
          <p>This will walk you through the Chrome developer tools. These tools are essential for debugging your work. One caveat, chrome has already advanced since they made this course, so you may find some icons have changed. You will obviously need to use Chrome for this, even all modern browsers to have developer tools of their own.
          <strong>You only need to do sections 1, 2 and 5.</strong> The others refer mostly to javascript debugging. And feel free to skip any of the challenges, since this is a little out of date, some of them won’t work correctly.</p>

          <h3>Journey into Mobile <em>(15 points)</em></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>This course walks you through how to design and develop websites for any device.</li>
            <li>Some notes: It&rsquo;s not usually necessary to convert your pixels to EMs anymore, but EMs still have their benefits.</li>
            <li>This is where stuff starts to get extremely opinionated and arguments about best practices start. Pay attention to the technical aspects of media queries, etc. But I&rsquo;ll definitely have things to say about &ldquo;mobile first&rdquo; and &ldquo;breakpoints.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>This course is also a little old, and there are some newer better options for things like responsive and retina images I&rsquo;ll talk about in class.</li>
